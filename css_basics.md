# CSS Basics
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
- It controls the layout and appearance of HTML elements.
- CSS can be added to HTML in three ways:
    a. Inline CSS (using the style attribute)
    b. Internal CSS (within the <style> tag in the <head>)
    c. External CSS (using a separate .css file)
